## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source tool that automates the deployment of an application inside a software container. Docker shares the OS kernel across all the containers running as separate processes of the host OS. Virtual Machines traditionally were used to isolate the app to make it independent of the system. The main problem with this is that an “extra OS” on top of the host operating system adds gigabytes of space to the project.
